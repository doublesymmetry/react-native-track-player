# Hooks

React v16.8 introduced [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). If you are using a version of React Native that is before [v0.59.0](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2019/03/12/releasing-react-native-059), your React Native version does not support hooks.

## `useTrackPlayerEvents`

Register an event listener for one or more of the [events](./events.md) emitted by the TrackPlayer. The subscription is removed when the component unmounts.

Check out the [events section](./events.md) for a full list of supported events.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { useTrackPlayerEvents, Event, State } from 'react-native-track-player';

// Subscribing to the following events inside MyComponent
const events = [Event.PlaybackState, Event.PlaybackError];

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [playerState, setPlayerState] = useState(null);

  useTrackPlayerEvents(events, (event) => {
    if (event.type === Event.PlaybackError) {
      console.warn('An error occured while playing the current track.');
    }
    if (event.type === Event.PlaybackState) {
      setPlayerState(event.state);
    }
  });

  const isPlaying = playerState === State.Playing;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>The TrackPlayer is {isPlaying ? 'playing' : 'not playing'}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

## `useProgress`

| State    | Type     | Description                      |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| position | `number` | The current position in seconds  |
| buffered | `number` | The buffered position in seconds |
| duration | `number` | The duration in seconds          |

`useProgress` accepts an interval to set the rate (in miliseconds) to poll the track player's progress. The default value is `1000` or every second.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { useProgress } from 'react-native-track-player';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { position, buffered, duration } = useProgress();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>
        Track progress: {position} seconds out of {duration} total
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Buffered progress: {buffered} seconds buffered out of {duration} total
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

## `usePlaybackState`

A hook which returns the up to date state of [`getPlaybackState()`](./functions/player.md#getplaybackstate).
The hook will initially return `{ state: undefined }` while it is awaiting the
initial state of the player.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import { usePlaybackState, State } from 'react-native-track-player';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const playerState = usePlaybackState();
  const isPlaying = playerState === State.Playing;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>The TrackPlayer is {isPlaying ? 'playing' : 'not playing'}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

## `usePlayWhenReady`

A hook which returns the up to date state of `TrackPlayer.getPlayWhenReady()`.

## `useActiveTrack`

A hook which keeps track of the currently active track using
`TrackPlayer.getActiveTrack()`, `Event.PlaybackActiveTrackChanged` and `Event.TrackMetadataUpdated`.

## `useNowPlayingMetadata`

A hook which keeps track of active now playing metadata in notification (Android) and the Now Playing Center (iOS) using
`TrackPlayer.getActiveTrack()`, `Event.NowPlayingMetadataUpdated` and `Event.TrackMetadataUpdated`.

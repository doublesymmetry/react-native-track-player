### `RemoteDuck`
Fired when the audio is interrupted. For example when a phone call arrives,

We recommend to set `autoHandleInterruptions: true` in
`TrackPlayer.setupPlayer`. This way toggling playback is handled automatically.

By default `autoHandleInterruptions` is set to `false` (default) in
`TrackPlayer.setupPlayer`, which means your app is expected to respond to this
event in the following situations:
- When the event is triggered with `paused` set to `true`, on Android playback
  should be paused. When `permanent` is also set to `true`, on Android the
  player should stop playback.
- When the event is triggered and `paused` is set to `false`, the player may
  resume playback.

| Param     | Type      | Description                                  |
| --------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| paused    | `boolean` | On Android when `true` the player should pause playback, when `false` the player may resume playback. On iOS when `true` the playback was paused and when `false` the player may resume playback. |
| permanent | `boolean` | Whether the interruption is permanent. On Android the player should stop playback.  |
